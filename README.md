# FlamencoAHK
A personal repo of AutoHotKey scripts I have created for my own personal/professional purposes and I found useful.

(-- WORK IN PROGRESS--)

## Trados.ahk 
A collection of AutoHotKeys I have written to automate several frequent, cumbersome tasks in SDL Trados. For example,
the "Paste several segments" hotkey is very powerful if you have guided an LLM to translate, say, 100 segments
in a customized way and now you want to paste the translation back into Trados for a final review / terminology / QA, etc.

To use any hotkey, just install AutoHotKeys, copy the hotkeys you would like to use into a .ahk plain-text file,
and double-click it.

That is all. Now you have automated your tasks.

Please feel free to contact me via LinkedIn if there are other tasks you would like to automate or make easier.
